## Selenium
Selenium is one of the most widely used open source Web UI (User Interface) automation testing suite.

It was originally developed by Jason Huggins in 2004 as an internal tool at Thought Works. 

Selenium supports automation across different browsers, platforms and programming languages.

Selenium automates browsers. That's it! 

What you do with that power is entirely up to you 

Primarily it is for automating web applications for testing purposes, but is certainly not limited to just that 

Boring web-based administration tasks can (and should) also be automated as well 


## Driver Initilization

WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver();<br>
WebDriver driver = new FirefoxDriver();<br>
WebDriver driver = new InternetExplorerDriver();<br>
WebDriver driver = new EdgeDriver();<br>
WebDriver driver = new SafariDriver();<br>
WebDriver driver = new HtmlUnitDriver();<br>

## Element Locators

driver.findElement(By.id("Id Value"));<br>
driver.findElement(By.name("Name Value"));<br>
driver.findElement(By.className("Class Name Value"));<br>
driver.findElement(By.linkText("Link text Value"));<br>
driver.findElement(By.partialLinkText("Partial Text Constant Value"));<br>
driver.findElement(By.tagName("Tag Name Value"));<br>
driver.findElement(By.cssSelector("CSS Value"));<br>
driver.findElement(By.xpath("Xpath Value"));<br>
driver.findElement(with(By.tagName("input")).above(passwordField));<br>
driver.findElement(with(By.tagName("input")).below(emailAddressField));<br>
driver.findElement(with(By.tagName("button")).toLeftOf(submitButton));<br>
driver.findElement(with(By.tagName("button")).toRightOf(submitButton));<br>
driver.findElement(with(By.tagName("input")).near(emailAddressLabel));<br>
driver.findElement(new ByAll(By.className("ElementClassName"),By.id("Element Id"), By.name("Element Name")))<br>
